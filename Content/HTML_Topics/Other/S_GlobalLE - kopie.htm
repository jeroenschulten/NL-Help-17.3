        <p>The Global Library Explorer is a special version of <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" />'s Library Explorer that you use to manage global libraries. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Global_libraries_1.flsnp" /></p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Global_libraries_2.flsnp" />
        <p>You use the Global Library Explorer <a href="../Conceptual/Library_Explorer/Using/Using_Library_Explorer.htm">in the same way that you use the standard Library Explorer</a> - you can create, edit and delete library objects, and amend the hierarchies of library objects.</p>
