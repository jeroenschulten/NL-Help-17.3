        <h1>Breaking down tasks into smaller steps using task activities</h1>
        <p>You can use task activities to break down tasks into smaller units of work. Rather than adding additional tasks to a schedule, which adds to its complexity, you can have one task in a project that is broken down into subtasks by task activities.</p>

                <p>In the following illustration, four tasks have been linked with Finish-to-Start links. However, two of the tasks have been completed before a predecessor task. This out of sequence progress means that the tasks are linked incorrectly:</p>

        <p>Using task activities, you could create a single 'Tarmac Driveways' task that covers all four driveways, with a task activity for each individual driveway. You could then progress the task activities in the order in which the driveways are tarmacked, and the 'Tarmac Driveways' task would be progressed appropriately: the order in which the task activities take place does not matter.</p>

                <p>In the following illustration, a single 'Tarmac Driveways' task has been created, with four task activities to represent the work to be carried out on each individual driveway. Two of the task activities have been completed; as the order of task activities does not matter, this does not result in out of sequence progress:</p>

        <p>Each task activity initially has a weighting of '1.00', so initially, each task activity contributes equally towards the progress of the task. You can apply weightings to task activities to increase or decrease their contribution towards task progress. For example, to double a task activity's contribution in comparison to the other activities, you would give it a weighting of '2.00'; to halve its contribution, you would give it a weighting of '0.50'.</p>

                <p>In the following illustration, the 'Tarmac Driveway Plot 2' task activity is 100% complete and has a weighting of '2.00', doubling its contribution towards the task's progress; the 'Tarmac Driveway Plot 4' task activity is 100% complete and has a weighting of '0.50', halving its contribution:</p>

        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>If you set a task activity's weighting to zero, it does not contribute towards task progress at all, regardless of the amount of progress on the task activity.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Illustration of how task activity weightings affect task progress</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The following calculation shows how task activity weightings affect task progress:</p>
                <p>((Activity 1 <span style="color: #008000;">% Complete</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">Weight</span>) + (Activity 2 <span style="color: #008000;">% Complete</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">Weight</span>) …) / (<span style="color: #0000ff;">Total of Weights</span>)</p>
                <p>If a task has four task activities, each with a weighting of '1.00', and if one task activity is complete, the task progress is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p>(<span style="color: #008000;">100</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) / <span style="color: #0000ff;">4</span> = 25</p>
                <p>The task is therefore 25% complete:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Graphics/Task_activities/taskactivities4.png" alt="A task with four task activities; one is complete, with a weighting of '1.00'" />
                </p>
                <p>If the first task activity had a weighting of '2.00', indicating that it should contribute twice as much to the progress of the task as the other activities, the task progress would be calculated as follows:</p>
                <p>(<span style="color: #008000;">100</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">2</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x<span style="color: #b22222;"> 1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) / <span style="color: #0000ff;">5</span> = 40</p>
                <p>The task would therefore be 40% complete:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Graphics/Task_activities/taskactivities5.png" alt="A task with four task activities; one is complete, with a weighting of '2.00'" />
                </p>
                <p>If the first task activity had a weighting of '0.50', indicating that it should contribute half as much to the progress of the task as the other activities, the task progress would be calculated as follows:</p>
                <p>(<span style="color: #008000;">100</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">0.5</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x<span style="color: #b22222;"> 1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) + (<span style="color: #008000;">0</span> x <span style="color: #b22222;">1</span>) / <span style="color: #0000ff;">3.5</span> = 14.29</p>
                <p>The task would therefore be 14.29% complete:</p>
                <p>
