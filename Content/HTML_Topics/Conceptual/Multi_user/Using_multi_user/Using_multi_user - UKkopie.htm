        <p><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Asta Enterprise Name" /> is designed to be used effectively in a multi-user environment. Rather than insist on users gaining exclusive access to the part of the project that they want to edit, users can work with the whole project at any time (within their <a href="../Specifying_user_access_rights/Specifying_user_access_rights.htm" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">access rights</a>) and always see up to date information. For example, if two or more users have the same task on their screens at the same time and one user makes a change, then the other users see their screens update when the first user has completed his edit.</p>
        <p>The key to using <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Asta Enterprise Name" /> is '<a href="Multi_user_locking.htm" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">object locking</a>'. When a user selects or edits an object, that object becomes locked to that user and can be viewed, but not edited by other users. When the first user saves or abandons their changes, the object becomes unlocked and other users can then select it for editing. This design ensures that all users, including remote users accessing the project through a modem connection, have equal access to the project and always see live data.</p>
