        <p>If you use <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> to manage multiple projects, you can use <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> to manage global libraries. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Global_libraries_1.flsnp" />This can save you a considerable amount of time.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If you do not use global libraries, each individual project has its own calendar, code library, progress period, quality check, permanent resource and consumable resource libraries, stored in the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> project file. You maintain these libraries by opening individual projects in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> and using Library&#160;Explorer. This way of working may suit you if you manage a disparate range of projects, with each project using different calendars, codes, resources, etc.</p>
                <p>If your projects all use the same set of calendars, codes, resources, etc, using global libraries can save you a significant amount of time, as this allows you to maintain a single - 'global' - library that contains the calendars, codes, resources, etc that are used throughout your projects. If you need to add a new permanent resource, edit a calendar or rename a code, using global libraries means that you only need to do this once, rather than having to make the same change in each individual project.</p>
                <p>If you enable the use of global libraries in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" />, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> creates a global library file that contains the libraries you choose to include.</p>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Global_libraries_2.flsnp" />
                <p>When you check out or download an <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> programme in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" />, the global library file is checked out automatically alongside the programme and its contents are merged into the programme. You can view and edit global library objects - for example, calendars, codes and resources - in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> using the Global Library Explorer. When you subsequently check in an <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> programme, the global library file is updated with any changes you have made to the global libraries while editing the programme. Your changes are then applied automatically to all other programmes when they are checked out.</p>

                <p>You use <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> to enable the use of global libraries, to specify which library object types are included in the global library file, and to specify which users are able to manage the global library file.

                    <li>Click <b>Vision</b>. A button appears for you to log into <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" />.</li>
                    <li>Log into <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" />.  A list of programmes to which you have access appears.

                    <li>Click a programme to check it out. The programme is checked out, along with the global library file, the contents of which are merged into the programme.</li>
                    <li>Once the programme has been checked out and appears in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" />, return to the <b>Open</b> tab of the Backstage view and click <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" style="font-weight: bold;" />.</li>

                    <li>If this is the first time you have edited the global library file, you will need to populate it with library objects.&#160;You can do this by creating them from scratch; or by opening one or more other projects in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> and copying and pasting library objects from Library Explorer into the Global Library Explorer; or by a combination of both these things.</li>
                    <li>Once you have finished editing the global library file, you need to <a href="Vision_checking_in.htm">check in the programme</a> - if you try to close the programme without checking it in, you are warned that you need to check in the programme to save the changes to the global library file. When you check in a programme, your changes to the global library file are uploaded to <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" />, and the updated global library file is now available in other programmes when they are checked out.</li>
