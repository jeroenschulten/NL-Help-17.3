        <p>If you use <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> to manage multiple projects, you can use <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> to manage global libraries. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Global_libraries_1.flsnp" />This can save you a considerable amount of time.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How global libraries work</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If you do not use global libraries, each individual project has its own calendar, code library, progress period, quality check, permanent resource and consumable resource libraries, stored in the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> project file. You maintain these libraries by opening individual projects in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> and using Library&#160;Explorer. This way of working may suit you if you manage a disparate range of projects, with each project using different calendars, codes, resources, etc.</p>
                <p>If your projects all use the same set of calendars, codes, resources, etc, using global libraries can save you a significant amount of time, as this allows you to maintain a single - 'global' - library that contains the calendars, codes, resources, etc that are used throughout your projects. If you need to add a new permanent resource, edit a calendar or rename a code, using global libraries means that you only need to do this once, rather than having to make the same change in each individual project.</p>
                <p>If you enable the use of global libraries in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" />, <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> creates a global library file that contains the libraries you choose to include.</p>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Global_libraries_2.flsnp" />
                <p>When you check out or download an <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" /> programme in <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" />, <MadCap:change MadCap:changes="2">Library Explorer is populated with library objects from the global library file, plus any library objects that have been created locally within the programme. Global library objects are identified in Library Explorer with a small blue cloud on the right of their icon: </MadCap:change><img src="../../../Graphics/Vision/globallibrarycloud.png" alt="A Library Explorer folder with a small blue cloud over the right side of it" MadCap:changes="2" /><MadCap:change MadCap:changes="2">.</MadCap:change><MadCap:change MadCap:changes="1">the global library file is checked out automatically alongside the programme and its contents are merged into the programme. You can view and edit global library objects - for example, calendars, codes and resources - in </MadCap:change><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" MadCap:changes="1" /><MadCap:change MadCap:changes="1"> using the Global Library Explorer.</MadCap:change> <MadCap:change MadCap:changes="3">When you subsequently check in an </MadCap:change><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Vision" MadCap:changes="3" /><MadCap:change MadCap:changes="3"> programme, the global library file is updated with any changes you have made to the global libraries while editing the programme. Your changes are then applied automatically to all other programmes when they are checked out.</MadCap:change></p>
                <p MadCap:changes="4">In checked out programmes, you can assign global library objects and view their properties, but you cannot edit or delete them; you can only edit or delete them within the Global Library Explorer. In downloaded programmes, you can assign global library objects, edit them and delete them, but your changes are not saved as you cannot commit any changes to downloaded programmes.</p>
                <p MadCap:changes="23">You can create and edit 'local' library objects - library objects that are specific to the programme in which they are created - within global libraries. For example, if your permanent resources are managed globally, you can still create a 'local' permanent resource. If you do this, the locally-created library objects will be available in that programme only, and will not be added to the global library file. You cannot create 'child' objects of global parents. For example, if there is a global 'Plumbers' permanent resource folder, you cannot create a local resource within that folder.</p>
                <p MadCap:changes="28">Note that you cannot set library access rights on global libraries; global libraries do not appear on the <b MadCap:changes="28">Security Group Properties</b> dialog.</p>
