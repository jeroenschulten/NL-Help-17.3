                </p>
                <p>You can now get around this problem by specifying an amount of leeway that each task is allowed before it is deemed to break the critical path integrity. You do this using the new <b>Days leeway</b> field that has been added to the reschedule options:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Graphics/Whats_new/wn1602daysleeway.png" alt="The new 'Days leeway' field, highlighted on the Reschedule dialog" />
                </p>
                <p>For example, if you specify 10d leeway, a task is allowed to increase in duration by up to 10d before it is deemed to break the critical path integrity. <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" /> defaults to allowing each task one day's leeway - and this is the minimum amount of leeway allowable - to allow for tasks that are configured to start on a new day.</p>
                <p>If you configure the reschedule to check the integrity of the critical path, the 'Scope and options' section of the reschedule report now shows the number of days' leeway that has been specified:</p>

                </p>
                <p>If you configure the reschedule to check the integrity of the critical path, the 'Critical tasks' section of the reschedule report now lists any tasks that break the critical path integrity:</p>

                <p>Before this release, the overall percent weighting of tasks was calculated to be the same as the task duration - unless you manually edited a task's weighting, in which case the value you had specified was used. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">Unless you had baselined a project, the </MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Easyplan_only">The </MadCap:conditionalText>weighting of progressed tasks would change if the tasks' duration remaining was changed subsequently. This behaviour was not ideal; once progress has been recorded against a task, its overall percent weighting should not change, even if the task's duration remaining is changed.</p>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name" MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only" /><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Easyplan Name" MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Easyplan_only" /> now uses a task's <i>original</i> duration to determine its overall percent weighting. The original duration is the duration of a task before any progress has been applied. If the duration of a task is changed before any progress has been applied, its weighting is updated automatically to reflect the new duration, but once progress is applied to a task, the weighting no longer changes, even if the duration of the task does.</p>
                <p>A <b>Calculated weight</b> field has been added to the 'Progress' fields, on the <b>Task</b> tab of the <b>Bar and Task Properties</b> dialog - and to the corresponding tab of the properties view.

If you want to override the weighting with your own value, enter this value in the <b>Overall % complete weight</b> field. This value then appears in the <b>Calculated weight</b> field, and does not change, even if the duration of the task changes.</p>
                <p>If you have manually edited the weighting of a task and subsequently want to revert to its weighting being calculated automatically, you can enter '1.00' in the <b>Overall % complete weight</b> field. The weighting will then be calculated automatically once more, according to its original duration in hours.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">In addition, baselining a project no longer has any effect on the overall percent weighting of a task.</p>

For example, if both the template and the project contained a code library called 'Location', the import would result in a project containing two 'Location' code libraries - one containing the codes from the template and the other containing the codes from the project you were importing. This behaviour was not ideal; in most cases, you would want the resulting project to contain a single 'Location' code library, containing both the codes from the template and the codes from the project.</p>
                <p>A <b>Match existing code libraries</b> check box has been added to the <b>Primavera XML &amp; XER Import Options</b> dialog.

                <h2>Better handling of projects that are located on a network drive</h2>
                <p>Before this release, if you opened a project <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">or baseline </MadCap:conditionalText>that was located on a network drive, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only"><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name"></MadCap:variable></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Easyplan Name" MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Easyplan_only"></MadCap:variable> opened the file directly. This could lead to problems if your network connection failed when the project was open.</p>
                <p>Now, when you work with a project <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">or baseline </MadCap:conditionalText>that is located on a network drive, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only"><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Powerproject Name"></MadCap:variable></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Easyplan Name" MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Easyplan_only"></MadCap:variable> does not open the project <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">or baseline </MadCap:conditionalText>directly; it takes a copy of the project <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">or baseline </MadCap:conditionalText>file, copies this to the temporary folder on your local computer, and opens this file. This improves performance when working with projects <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">and baselines </MadCap:conditionalText>that are located on a network drives and reduces the possibility of file errors caused by network problems.</p>
                <p>Each time you save, the original file on the network is synchronised with the local copy, in such a way to minimise the possibility of network errors causing problems during the save operation - the file being saved is saved under a new file name on the network, then this file is given the same name as the original file. For large files, a progress indicator appears each time this happens, indicating the progress of the save operation:</p>

                    </img>
                </p>
                <p>If a save operation to a network location fails, you are given the option to save the file to a different location.</p>
                <p>While you work on a project <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">or baseline </MadCap:conditionalText>that is located on a network drive, even though you are actually working on a local copy of the file, the project <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">or baseline </MadCap:conditionalText>on the network drive is locked to prevent other users from accessing it.</p>
