            <p>By default, the start date of a project is the day on which it is created, and the finish date <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">- which is calculated by rescheduling - </MadCap:conditionalText>is the date on which the latest task in the project finishes. Rather than having to accept these default dates, you can specify a different start date or finish date for the project.</p>
            <p>If you specify a different start date, this is known as an 'imposed start' date; if you specify a different finish date, this is known as an 'imposed finish' date. You cannot specify both an imposed start date and an imposed finish date<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Powerproject_Easyplan.Powerproject_only">; if you specify one of these dates, the other date is calculated by rescheduling</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
            <p>To specify an imposed start or finish date for a project:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click <b>File</b>, then <b>Properties</b> to view the <b>Properties</b> tab of the Backstage view.</li>
                <li>Enter the date on which you want the project to start in the <b>Imposed start</b> field, or enter the date on which you want the project to finish in the <b>Imposed finish</b> field.</li>
            </ol>
        </MadCap:microContent>
        <p>Note that if you change the imposed start date to a date that is later than the report date of one or more existing progress periods, a warning appears. If this warning appears, click <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OK</b> to amend the report dates of your progress periods so that they start on or after the new imposed start date, click <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Close</b> to set the new imposed start date but leave the report dates of the progress periods unaffected, or click <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cancel</b> to abandon your change to the imposed start date. If you click <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Close</b>, you will need to edit the report dates of the progress periods manually.</p>
