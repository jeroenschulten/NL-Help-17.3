    <body>You cannot work on a project while it is in the process of being saved. While this should not be a problem with small projects, you may find that automatic saves interrupt your flow when you work with larger projects. If you are working with a very large project, you might find it useful to disable auto-saving so that the automatic saves do not interrupt your work.</body>
