    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">The act of moving historical data from a live project into an archive file. You can only archive data if you use Asta Enterprise. A project can have more than one archive. You may, for example, want to create a single archive for a project, and update it each time you archive data. Alternatively, you may want to create a different archive each time you archive data. Archives can be located in a different data source to the corresponding projects, provided that each archive is located on the same Enterprise server as the project. Data from any baselines that are associated with a project is archived into a separate baseline archive. As with project archives, baseline archives can be located in a different data source to the corresponding baseline, provided that each baseline archive is located on the same Enterprise server as the baseline.</Definition>

You can open a baseline as a separate project, or display it within its original project to compare the baselined tasks against the current plan. If you have built up a portfolio of projects within one file by identifying that individual charts and summary groups are projects themselves, you can associate a different baseline with each individual project. Once a baseline has been associated with a project, it is known as a 'project baseline'. From version 15.0.01 onwards, new baselines can be embedded within the project, making it easy to distribute projects along with their baselines.</Definition>

You may find it useful to produce reschedule reports for a number of reasons - for example, to locate and resolve link loops, to locate inconsistencies regarding constraints, and to identify the tasks that are on the longest path - ie the critical path - through the project network. The reschedule report is extremely useful for critical path analysis, and provides you with metrics on the quality of planned projects. For example, critical path analysis demands that a project network should have just one start task and just one finish task and that there should be no link loops or out of sequence progress; you can use the reschedule report to identify whether or not this is the case in a project. The reschedule report can be configured to appear in your web browser and to be saved as a log file.</Definition>

A resource curve consists of a number of discrete rectangular segments - or 'points' - each of which defines a percentage of duration and a corresponding level of allocation. For example, if a resource curve has ten points, the first segment relates to the first 10% of an allocation's duration and defines the amount of allocation that relates to that segment. You can configure resource curves to accurately represent the varying levels of effort, quantity or cost across the duration of the allocations to which the resource curve is assigned.</Definition>

A number of date fields allow you to specify variable dates. You can apply offsets to variable dates, using time units - both working and elapsed. For example, you can specify 'Month start+1ew' (the start date of the current month plus one elapsed week) or 'Today-3d' (three working days before today's date).</Definition>

Each element within a work breakdown structure element may represent a product, data, a service, or any combination of the above. A WBS also provides a framework for detailed cost estimating and control. A work breakdown structure is a tree structure, in which all of the elements on one level are summarised by elements on the level above. A WBS is useful when you want to break down the work involved in a project, starting from the main phases of the project and expanding right down to the individual tasks that must be carried out. Each element within a WBS is identified by an alphanumeric WBS code and a descriptive WBS name.</Definition>

    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">For tasks, the difference between the report date of a specified progress period and the start or resume date of a task. A positive value indicates that work is ahead of schedule; a negative value indicates that work is behind schedule. You can display the Slip field in the spreadsheet and you can filter for tasks with a particular amount of slip, which helps you to identify tasks which are very far behind schedule - or very far ahead of schedule. For summary and expanded tasks, slip is calculated as being the difference between the report date and the task's effective progress date. The effective progress date for a summary or expanded task is calculated from the task's percentage complete and duration. The percentage complete for a summary or expanded task is calculated as the total actual duration of the child tasks, divided by the total duration of the child tasks.</Definition>

      <Term>Duration percent complete progress</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A measurement of progress that is based on the percentage of the duration of a task that has been completed. For example, if 40% of a task has been completed, you can record that the task is 40% complete, meaning that 60% of the task remains to be completed. This is a simple method of calculating progress, and one in which the progress of a task is always linked to the task's duration. Calculating progress in this way is most useful if you assign resources to your tasks.</Definition>

      Link="">A measurement of progress that is independent of the duration of a task. For example, if 20% of the planned duration of a task has been worked but 50% of the task has been completed, you can record that the task is 20% complete as a percentage of its duration but that it is 50% overall complete. Calculating progress in this way is most useful if you do not assign resources to your tasks.</Definition>

      <Term>Delivery date</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">The date on which a project must be delivered. You can specify a delivery date for the programme of projects, and a delivery date for each chart or summary group that has been identified as being a project. You can use a project's delivery date as a deadline when rescheduling. If you do this, rather than using the finish date of the last task in the project, the project's late and free finish dates are set to the delivery date when rescheduling and float is calculated out to the project's delivery date. A delivery date provides a deadline for all tasks in the project, so any tasks that exceed the delivery date have negative float (ie they become super-critical) following a reschedule. The delivery date is also used when checking the quality of a schedule to calculate the project's maximum duration, which is the difference between the project's start date and its delivery date.</Definition>
